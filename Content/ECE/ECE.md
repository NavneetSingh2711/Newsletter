# Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering Engineering  

## Message from HoD's Desk
The Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, established in 1981, is one of the most dynamic departments of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College. It was the first major diversification initiative by the college, 25 years after its establishment. The department is currently running Bachelors and Masters of Technology courses in Electronics and Communication Engineering and has around 10 scholars enrolled for doctorate in areas like Antenna Design, VLSI, Optical communication etc. Ever since its inception, the department has been the hub of academic excellence through some great teachers who have laid a sound foundation as well as the cream of students of the region, who have spread their wings all over the globe. The alumni of the department are not only excelling in India but also in the Silicon Valley and other hubs of Electronics Technology. They are at the forefront of the Telecom revolution of the last 20 years and manning pivotal positions in Telecom operators in India, South East Asia, Pacific region and Africa.

In the last few years, as a part of an academically autonomous system, the department has taken numerous quality initiatives including revamping of syllabi so that it is in tune with the outcome based system as proposed in the Washington Accord. I urge the current students to be worthy emulators of the legacy of their seniors for the glory of their Institute.

## Department at Glimpse


- **Webinar Lecture Series on "Information Security"**

Dr. Harsimranjit Singh Gill(Coordinator)

![2](Images/2.jpg)

Under the NPIU program, “Train-the-Trainer”, 4-week job-oriented training programme titled “Webinar Lecture Series on Information Security” sponsored by TEQIP-III was organized for the students of ECE, IT, and CSE from 02-11-2020 to 27-11-2020.
The main aim of the training programme was to spread awareness and motivate students to learn, work, and contribute in the field of cyber security. Apart from discussion of theoretical concepts of information security, hands-on-training session were also conducted to comprehend the prominent areas of field.


- **Project on "Automatic hand sanitizer dispenser"**

![mon](Images/mon.jpg)

Innovation is a blast whenever it is utilized in a correct way. With such a vision in mind, our final year Student, Montekpal Singh, ECE Branch, have developed ‘automatic hand sanitizer dispenser’ for all of us keeping in mind the Covid-19 pandemic, under the guidance of ECE Faculty members. This project is capable of detecting and cleaning the person’s hands with the use of sensors and microcontroller. Furthermore, it has features like easy refillable tank and smartly controlled spray system which permits the use of sanitizer efficiently without any wastage. Moreover, the system was tested vigorously for any problems and reliability issues. The project has successfully placed in college premises to benefit everyone with its service.
Features include:
-	All the components used in manufacturing of the Dispenser are made in India.
-	The intelligent Dispenser is capable of detecting the distance from the person’s hands with the help of IR sensors.
-	Either in broad daylight or at night, the sensor is able to detect the presence of hands.
-	It gives a beeping sound while running and stops after 2 seconds of spraying to save sanitizer use.
-	The detachable tank makes refilling and cleaning very easy.
-	Every possible problem that is present in the already available dispensers in the market like sanitizer dripping leakage, running because of sunlight glare on its own, all has been addressed in this project.
